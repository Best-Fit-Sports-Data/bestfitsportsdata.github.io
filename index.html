      <h1>Welcome to Best Fit Sports Data</h1>
      
      <h3>Please be patient while our website is under construction!</h3>
      
      <p>We provide basketball analytics tailor made for YOUR team. Using our unique methods, we look beyond the Four Factors to determine what each individual player does that helps the team win. Powered by the progamming language R, we account for individual performances and the team as a whole to provide the most in depth look at a team, and build predictive models to help coaches set goals for their teams.</p>

      <p>Take a look at our examples page to get a better understanding of the services we provide. Read about how this project came about in the About page. And sign up for services today on the contact page!</p>
