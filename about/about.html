    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>How we got started</h2>
        <p>Best Fit Sports Data was started in the spring of 2024. I had been working as a fiber optic splicer for a while, and the work had run out; I was to be without work for about 4 months. During that time off, I began looking at other jobs to see if I could find something new that would get me working ASAP.</p>

        <p>During my job search, I realized that many employers wanted someone that could work with software as well as the fiber. So, I decided to go back to school do get a degree in Data Science with certifications in Python and Application Development.</p>

        <p>I'm the type of person who, even though they are going to start taking classes, wants to start teaching themselves skills before starting them. So, I began reading up on how to code and how to work with data in one of my life-long loves: basketball. One of my high school teachers had taken a job as an assistant coach at Northwest Missouri State, and I decided to work with some data from his team. I had been a student at Northwest for three years &#x28;before graduating from Northern Iowa&#x29;, so it worked out perfectly.</p>

        <p>He ended up leaving for a different job, but I still had all this data, so I began reaching out to other coaches in the conference. I got a few meetings, and they seemed to like the information that I had. As I was still out of work, I began to run with this idea of starting business from this work.</p>

        <p>Since then, the project has taken on a life of it's own. I hope to find more coaches to work with and eventually make this a full time job. I love college basketball, and it's always been a dream of mine to work in sports. I hope to add you to the list of team's I can partnet with.</p>

    <h2>About Ben DeMouth</h2>
        <p>I reside in Des Moines, IA with my dog, Stanzi. I moved here in 2021 after graduating from Northern Iowa with a degree in Sports Public Relations. I spent most of my time in college working at Radio on the Go, broadcasting on KLMJ and KQCR in North Central Iowa.</p>

        <p>I hadn't expected to leave the radio industry, but a job offer that was too good to turn down presented itself upon graduation. I took that job and worked doing financial services for semi-truck drivers for a few years. When that company was sold, I began working as a fiber optic splicer before eventually starting Best Fit Sports Data.</p>

        <p>I played basketball on the AAU circuit growing up, travelling around the country playing for the Iowa Battlers. I was set to play college basketball, before breaking my leg during the summer between my junior and senior years of high school. That ended my playing career, but basketball has maintained a special place in my heart.</p>

        <p>When not working on school or trying to build Best Fit Sports Data, I'm very involved in community service in Des Moines. I volunteer once a week at Powell CDC, and help people early in recovery with trying to find housing and employment. I also love to take my dog out for hikes and working out in my garden growing vegetables.</p>
