    <h1>Here are some examples of our work</h1>

        <h2>Correlation Matrices</h2>

            
            <div class="example_container">

            </div>

            <p>Correlation matrices are at the core of everything that we do. Each player gets their own personal correlation matrix. These tools measure how correlated everything a player does is to everything else that happens in the game. There is a lot of data contained in there that is unnecessary &#x28;a player's field goal attempts is probably not going to be related to the team's steals&#x29;, but the key to maximizing each player is containted here. How does a player's field goal attempts correlate to team offensive efficiency? Is it more important for your star player to score the ball a ton or is it more valuable for them to distribute the ball? Does playing your energy player off the bench really help the team on the defensive end? All these questions and more are answered in the correlation matrices. Luckily, we know where to look for the imortant data.</p>

            <p>These correlation matrices use Pearson correlation coefficients. Developed by English mathmetrician Karl Pearson, these coefficients measure how much of the variance in one variable is related to the variance in the other variable. For a set of two numbers, we get a single number between -1 and 1. The closer the number is to 1, the more positively correlated the two are. The closer the number is to -1, the more negatively correlated the two are. If you run these formulas for every stat recorded by a player and the team, you get a correlation matrix. Do this for every stat recorded by every player for every game, and you get a pretty good picture of what everyone does well.</p>

        <h2>Visualizing the Data</h2>

            <div class="example_container">
                <img src="example_photos/FGA Graph.png" alt="Data Visualization">
            </div>
            
            <p>Those correlation matrices can be pretty daunting to look at. Don't worry, we'll make it easy for you. Once we know what each player does that has a strong correlation to team performance, then we have an idea of what to study.</p>

            <p>Take the example above. Each dot represents a single game. The blue line is the best fit line showing the relationship between the two variables. In this case, we have a player that shoots the ball a lot and how that affects team offensive efficiency. We can see that it is good for her to get shots up to a certain point, but after a while it starts to hurt the team efficiency.</p>

            <p>We will create graphs like this for each player on your team with each stat they have that has a strong correlation to team performance. In addition to helping you make coaching decisions, it helps players understand why you make the decisions you do.</p>

        <h2>Setting Goals with Machine Learning</h2>
            
            <div class="example_container">
                <img src="example_photos/LM Model.png" alt="Linear Regression Model">
            </div>

            <p>Once we know what each player does, it's time to set some goals for the team. Remember learing y = mx + b and thinking that it would never be useful again? Well, that's what we're doing here.</p>

            <p>We take a bunch of x variables and feed them into the machine learning model. Along the way, some of the stuff that we thought was correlated may be more random than we expected. That's okay. We just remove that from the model to get a better fit.</p>

            <p>What we're left with is an estimated value of each action. For this example, the game really came down to two players getting assists, steals, and field goal attempts. We can use these numbers to set goals.</p>

            <p>The R-squared value estimates how much of the variance in our y-variable &#x28;net team rating&#x29; is explained by these x-variable. For this example, between 85.5&#x25;-88.1&#x25; of the team's net rating was explained by these four stats.</p>

            <p>The p-value gives an estimate of how much of this could be attributed to random chance. This model says that there is only 0.00000000418&#x25; percent chance that this is random. That's really good. We've developed models like this for every team that we work for, and you could be next.</p>
